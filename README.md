# Image-Classification-Using-CNN
This project focuses on building an image classification model using TensorFlow, designed to categorize images into distinct classes. The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for analyzing visual data. To enhance the model's accuracy and robustness, the project includes a data preprocessing pipeline that handles image resizing and normalization. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are applied to diversify the training samples, helping the model generalize better on unseen images.

Throughout this project, TensorFlow's powerful tools are leveraged to construct and train the CNN, allowing it to automatically learn and recognize complex patterns in the data. After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset, providing insights into its classification accuracy and potential areas for improvement. This project serves as a practical application of deep learning techniques for image classification, offering a foundation for further exploration in computer vision.
